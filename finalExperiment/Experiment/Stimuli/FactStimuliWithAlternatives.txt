Specifically, we are interested in how taking an initial test affects your ability to remember that initially tested information. More specifically, we are interested in how taking multiple-choice tests versus cued-recall tests affects the number of responses that come to mind during a final test, your recall of the correct response, and your confidence in recalling that response.<br><u>Why is this important to scientists or the general public?</u><br>Teachers give tests in classrooms primarily to assess how much their students know.  We think that tests should be used for more than assessment„that they should also be used as opportunities to learn.  This research will help us to learn how to construct tests that can serve optimally as learning opportunities.<br><u>What if I have questions later?</u><br>If you have questions, please contact Jeri Little at jerilittle@gmail.com"	N/A	N/A	OFF	Initial Study
